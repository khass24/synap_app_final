# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Hello there,

Here is my best shot at creating this CRM application using Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.2, with a PostgreSQL database. 

I understand how this app SHOULD work but I have put about 7-8 hours of research and coding into this and just can't crack the CSV importing correctly to mesh with the dependecies that I have written in i.e Organization has_many People etc. I've pored over multiple articles and videos on how to properly import the CSV into multiple models with varying dependencies, but I just couldn't crack it.

If you'd like, you can look over the code that I have written into the app including where I ultimately came up short in the seeds.rb file (I'd love to hear how this would ultimately be done as it has caused me several hours of headache). I haven't pushed to Heroku because as I said I could not get it to function properly in the end.

Thank you for your time and have a nice rest of your day.
